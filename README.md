# FileBrowser
CS 320, Team 2 Project Repository


##Project details

FileBrowser is an intuitive, user-friendly service that provides support experts the tools 
they need to make their customersâ€™ lives simpler. This service was designed for integration 
with HPE's architecture, which would provide them with long-term storage of all call-home files, 
and would allow support users the ability to query for and download particular files of interest.
